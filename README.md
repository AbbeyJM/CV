## Abbey Minett

I'm an everlearning individual who is always looking to branch into new areas and learn more skills! By being like this I have a brilliant job with Apple, an undergraduate degree on the way, and have completed Makers. 
The one thing that excites me about tech the most is the frontend part of development, particularly the CSS, I love love love seeing my projects come to life!

- Communication

-STAR
- First learning to use CSS and then TailwindCSS.

- Used on both Fishbook and Bakery Manager.

- I learnt CSS and then TailwindCSS from scratch over the course of these two projects, initial CSS took 3 days to learn and Tailwind only took 1 day to truly get the hang of.

- I gained the relevant skills to design our websites, and bring them to life. Taking into account everyone's preferences.


#### Communication

- In both my current position at Apple and throughout my Makers experience communication has been key. Often saving us from further issues down the line by going through them before they arrise.
- Successful projects
- Within Makers communication has been important so that everyone on the project is aware of what is happening at any given moment. When one's communication falls through it often can be difficult to know what they're doing/accomplishing for the project, so i prioritised this. An example of this is how on Bakery Manger, two other team members and I would stay on Zoom all day, being avaliable when required, but also so we knew what was being done.
